Poker
=====

As the name suggests this is a Poker game,similar to the Texas Hold'em Poker you all must have played on Facebook.The language that has been used in development is C#.The main motto behind making this project open source is implementation of Hand evaluation part.It requires the implementation of a Hand Evaluation library "XPokerEval" which is worth trying your hands on.So if anyone finds this interesting and do contribute in it.
