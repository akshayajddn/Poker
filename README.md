Poker
=====

As the name suggests this is a Poker game,similar to the Texas Hold'em Poker you all must have played on Facebook.The language that has been used in development is C#.The main motto behind making this project open source is implementation of Hand evaluation part.It requires the implementation of a Hand Evaluation library "XPokerEval" which is worth trying your hands on.Implementing this part will give you a solid grasp of hashing.So friends google the library,implement it and share here.When you google it,you will find many versions of the library in C,C#.So if anyone interested in the project but not familiar with C#.He/she can go through the C code and discuss the logic here.That would also be of very great help.
